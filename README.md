## BillyDJ
A DJ bot that plays music posted in the designated channel.

Features:
 - **Play music.** Self-explanatory. Will avoid playing songs that were played recently.
 - **Now playing.** With `dj!np` or simply a mention of the bot, the bot will reply with the name and the artist of the currently playing song. Also provides a link to the original message with the song for the user to approve the music they like.
 - **Hall of mashups.** After enough people have approved a song by adding the approved reaction to the message, the bot will post it to the Hall of Mashups, where it stays permanently for people to listen.

## BillyBOT
Inside jokes in bot form. No useful features, only memes.

Some highlights:
 - **/peakefficiencyflip:** Connect to [justflipacoin](https://justflipacoin.com) with an async web browser, wait for the website to generate the coin flip, then send back the result.
 - **/dm:** Direct message a user as the bot to creep people out on April Fools.
 - **/flirt:** Attempt to flirt with the bot. On the third successful attempt, the bot will give you "BillyBOT's Boyfriend" role. The bot will only accept flirts in German, from a German Duolingo lesson.
